	<p>A customer approached SFT about making shoes for him; his first through third toes on both feet 
	were amputated after experiencing frostbite. He already had custom shoes made from casts of his feet,
	but these shoes' toeboxes were too rounded, limiting his ability to edge (stand on small 
	rock features) or crack climb (requires wedging the toebox into a crack and twisting
	one's foot to create a camming effect).</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="tabContent" id="design">
  <div>
	<img src="PortfolioItems/sft-meche-portfolio-01.png" width="400px" style="float:right;"/>
	<dl>
	<dt>This shoe should restore the experience of securely edging:</dt>
	<dd><li>the part of the toebox that extends past the customer's foot should be stiff enough to 
	transfer his weight to a small feature</li></dd>
	<dt>while retaining some smearing ability:</dt>
	<dd><li>the toebox should be able to flex the same amount as an OTS shoe would under the same 
	load.</li></dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The material and geometry of the midsole will control the flexibility of the toebox, so I 
	began by analyzing the midsole as a cantilevered beam, loaded with the worst-case
	scenario (the customer's full weight applied to the tip of the toebox).</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="tabContent" id="analysis">
  <div>
    <p>Simplifying assumptions:</p>
	<li>The customer's foot is rigid and perfectly coupled to the shoe and midsole. Therefore, the 
	midsole can be treated as a cantilevered beam beyond the end of the customer's foot.</li>
	<li>All of the customer's weight is applied to a small area on the distal end of the midsole. The 
	customer and his climbing gear applies about 750N.</li>
	<li>The midsole is a rectangular beam with a width of 61 mm. (It actually tapers towards the distal end, 
	but most of the bending will occur at the beam base, and the final shoe will be slightly stiffer than 
	the midsole alone as it will also include a rubber sole, suede upper, and sculpted rubber cap to fill
	the toebox).</li>
	<li>OTS shoes flex between 6 and 12 mm under load.</li>
	<p>Preliminary analysis suggested that to be stiff enough, a plastic-only midsole would push the yield 
	strength of the material. I decided to build the midsole out of polypropylene sheet (since it had close 
	to the desired modulus and yield strength) riveted to spring steel shim stock (to keep the plastic from 
	yielding).</p>
	<p>With the above assumptions and material choices, I calculated how long the midsole "beam" should 
	be to provide the desired tip deflection with the standard beam bending equation:</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;" lang="latex">\delta = \frac{PL^3}{3EI}</p>
	<p>where &#948; = deflection, P = load, L = beam length, E = Young's Modulus, and I = area moment of inertia.</p>
	<p>To simplify the calculation, I treated the plastic-and-metal composite beam as a T-beam of steel alone. 
	The cross-bar of the T had the dimensions of the original steel part, and the vertical of the T had 
	the thickness of the plastic part and the equivalent width of steel to yield the same bending stiffness as 
	the original plastic part alone. This resulted in a T-beam with the dimensions shown in the image:</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="PortfolioItems/sft-meche-portfolio-04.png" width="450px"/></p>
	<p>The equivalent T-beam has an area moment of inertia of about 0.699 mm<sup>4</sup>. Solving for the 
	beam length:</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;" lang="latex">L = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3EI\delta}{P}}</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;" lang="latex">L = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3(200 GPa)(0.699 mm^4)(7 mm)}{750 N}}</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;" lang="latex">L \approx 16 mm</p>
	<p><b>Therefore, the midsole should extend about 16 mm beyond the end of the customer's natural foot for 
	the toebox of his shoes to have similar flexibility to OTS shoes and allow the customer to edge comfortably.</b></p>
