	<p>This project is also documented on the <a href="https://www.sftclimbing.com/blogs/design/42717956-improving-the-heel-design" title="SFT Design Blog">SFT Design Blog</a>.</p>
	<p>Because everyone's feet are different, from a small pool of customers in our beta program, SFT 
	was able to stretch the design to its limits. The same CAD model used for narrow, 
	"Egyptian-toed" feet could be changed in 2 minutes to fit a person with wide feet 
	and "Morton's toes." The toebox design had proved quite flexible.</p>
	<p>However, fitting peoples' heels had been more difficult. After taking 
	measurement after measurement, making visual comparison's of customers' bone 
	structures, and building many prototypes to test various hypotheses, I made 
	progress in determining how much narrower the last should be than one's foot 
	tracing to account for movement of the flesh around the heel. However, each prototype seemed to fit a little differently around the 
	Achilles tendon.</p>
	<p>Since this issue was consistent for many customers, there wear clearly some faulty 
	assumptions in the last's heel and ankle design. Since I had built up quite a 
	volume of prototypes, all with different materials, rand designs, and many other facets, 
	I decided to conduct a survey of heel comfort versus all the variables that might 
	affect heel fit.</p>
  </div>

<div class="tabContent" id="debug">
  <div>
    <p>I selected 13 existing prototypes, 5 of which were adjustable, and one reference off-the-shelf shoe
	to try on and rate in terms of comfort. Then I collected data on heel angle, rand design, and six other 
	variables and calculated correlation coefficients between these variables and the 
	comfort ratings.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="PortfolioItems/comfort_ratings.png" width="600px"/></p>
	<p>The orange bars indicate comfort ratings (each prototype was sampled three 
	times), and the blue line indicates the average comfort rating.</p>
	<p>When calculating correlation coefficients, prototypes with a comfort rating 
	standard deviation of greater than 0.8 (graphically speaking: prototypes where 
	the average rating differs greatly from the three samples) were not included.</p>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="tabContent" id="results">
  <div>
  <p>The correlation coefficients indicated that heel stiffness was the variable with 
  the greatest effect on heel comfort, followed by heel angle and whether or not the 
  heel rand was continuous. The other variables measured were not significantly 
  correlated to heel comfort.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="PortfolioItems/improving_heel_design.jpg" width="600px"/></p>
  <p>All of SFT's concurrent shoes have drawn on the information learned from this 
  prototype survey, and our customers noted how much more comfortable the heels were. 
  One customer who received a pair shortly after this said, "The heel fits like a 
  glove and this shoe looks absolutely fantastic."</p>
